# HackLuminary (MindCore · Luminary)

> **Turn projects into presentations. Automatically.**

HackLuminary is a CLI-first, local-only, deterministic tool that generates a **complete hackathon-ready presentation** directly from a project’s codebase and supporting documents.

It eliminates the final, painful hours of slide creation by producing a **chronologically correct, judge-aligned deck** with clear visuals, diagrams, and structured storytelling.

HackLuminary does not help you build software.  
It helps you **explain it convincingly**.

## Why HackLuminary Exists

Hackathon teams consistently fail at presentations because:
- Slides are rushed or unfinished
- Storytelling is unclear
- Slides are out of order
- Teams forget to address judging criteria
- Visuals are inconsistent or missing
- Too much time is spent formatting instead of refining the pitch

HackLuminary removes slide-making as a bottleneck.
